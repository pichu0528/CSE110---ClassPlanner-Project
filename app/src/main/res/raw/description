CSE 3-Introduces the concepts and skills necessary to effectively use information technology. Includes basic concepts and some practical skills with computer and networks. Prerequisites: none.
CSE 5A-(Formerly CSE 62A) Introduction to algorithms and top-down problem solving. Introduction to the C language, including functions, arrays, and standard libraries. Basic skills for using a PC graphical user interface operating system environment. File maintenance utilities are covered. (A student may not receive credit for CSE 5A after receiving credit for CSE 10 or CSE 11 or CSE 8B or CSE 9B or CSE 62B or CSE 65.) Prerequisites: A familiarity with high-school level algebra is expected, but this course assumes no prior programming knowledge.
CSE 7-Fundamentals of computer programming and basic software design covering topics related to variables, functions, and control structures; writing, testing, and debugging programs in Matlab. Examples focus on scientific applications. Recommended preparation: high school algebra and familiarity with the computing milieu. Students with limited computing experience may take CSE 3 for preparation. Students may not take CSE 7 after completing COGS 18. Program or material fee may apply. Prerequisites: none.
CSE 8A-Introductory course for students interested in computer science. Fundamental concepts of applied computer science using media computation. Exercises in the theory and practice of computer science. Hands-on experience with designing, editing, compiling, and executing programming constructs and applications. CSE 8A is part of a two-course sequence (CSE 8A and CSE 8B) that is equivalent to CSE 11. Students should take CSE 8B to complete this track. Formerly offered as corequisite courses CSE 8A plus 8AL. Students who have taken CSE 8B or CSE 11 may not take CSE 8A. Recommended preparation: No prior programming experience is assumed, but comfort using computers is helpful. Students should consult the CSE Course Placement Advice web page for assistance in choosing which CSE course to take first.Prerequisites: none.
